                <p>I was born in McAllen, Texas, a town just a few miles north of the Texas/Mexico border. I graduated from high school with honors and then fulfilled a longtime dream of attending my parents alma mater, the University of Texas at Austin, where I earned college honors through achieving a 3.7 overall GPA, after double-majoring in English Literature and Geography. <br />Upon graduation, I added to my identity capital through attending Austin Coding Academy to become a full-stack web developer, and pick up a valuable life skill that will only appreciate in value in the future. I plan to complete their entire 3-module program, then either look for work as a junior web developer, or attend graduate or law school.

                Some of my other interests incude British history, equestrian sports and horse rescue, reading biographies of famous historical women, happiness research, basketball and football. I also am interested in raising awareness for invisible illnesses like the one I am afflicted with, <a className="inlinelink" href="http://www.dysautonomiainternational.org/page.php?ID=30" target="_blank">POTS Syndrome</a>, and one of the newer scourges of millenials, <a className="inlinelink" href="http://fightthenewdrug.org/" target="_blank">porn addiction</a>. I live in the greater Austin area with my Westie, <a href="#indie">Indiana Jones.</a></p>
